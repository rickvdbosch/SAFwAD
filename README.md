# SAFwAD

This repo holds the sources used in my talk *Securing an Azure Function REST API with Azure Active Directory*.
You can find the resulting website here: [rickvdbos.ch/safwad](https://safwadstorage.z6.web.core.windows.net/). Have a look at the
footer, since it holds links to all (Azure) services used for this talk. The website uses the *unauthenticated* version of the [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).  

>**Build apps faster with a serverless architecture**  
>Accelerate your development with an event-driven, serverless compute experience. Scale on demand and pay only for the resources you consume.
